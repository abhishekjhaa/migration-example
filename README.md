Most of my time was spent on building the microservice functionality and architecting the migration strategy.

For the microservices, my focus was on establishing clear domain boundaries and clean, consistent APIs. I introduced shared libraries, payload validation, and enforced the JSON:API response spec along with Swagger documentation. These design choices improve developer productivity and ensure consistency across teams as the system scales.

I also added comprehensive integration tests to validate end-to-end behavior and catch regressions early. Since the business logic is relatively straightforward, unit tests were not necessary at this stage; however, as the system grows in complexity, we can layer them in for deeper coverage.

On the migration front, my emphasis was on ensuring the ORM-based logic matches the original stored procedures, preserving business correctness while modernizing the stack. I‚Äôve documented the detailed migration architecture and process in the Architecture.md file.

For Docker builds, I ensured they are reproducible and platform-agnostic‚Äîthe deploy-local command runs seamlessly (tested on macOS).

I used AI coding agents to accelerate certain steps, such as generating CloudFormation templates and consolidating documentation, though I‚Äôve marked the parts I couldn‚Äôt fully verify yet.

Overall, this effort modernizes the system into a scalable, observable, and developer-friendly architecture, ready for CI/CD and trunk-based delivery.

# Order Management System - Microservices Architecture

A modernized Order Management System built with NestJS microservices, featuring PostgreSQL, Redis caching, and production-ready AWS ECS deployment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- AWS CLI (for cloud deployment)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository>
cd migration-example
npm install

# Start all services
npm run deploy:local

# Or start individual services
npm run dev:order      # Order Service (port 3001)
npm run dev:invoice    # Invoice Service (port 3004)
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Order Service
curl http://localhost:3004/health  # Invoice Service

# View API documentation
open http://localhost:3001/api/docs  # Order Service docs
open http://localhost:3004/api/docs  # Invoice Service docs
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Services
- **Order Service** (Port 3001): Order management and customer operations
- **Invoice Service** (Port 3004): Invoice creation and calculations
- **Migration Service** (Port 3000): Legacy data migration and reconciliation
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with Prisma ORM
- **Redis**: Multi-layer caching with 10-50x performance improvement

### Port Allocation
| Service | Local | Integration Tests |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL | 5433 | 5434 |
| Redis | 6379 | 6380 |
| Order Service | 3001 | 3003 |
| Invoice Service | 3004 | 3005 |
